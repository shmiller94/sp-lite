# Questionnaire

## Overview

This directory contains various types of questionnaire components used for collecting user input in different formats. It is based on Medplum Questionnaires which can be found here: https://www.medplum.com/products/questionnaires

**Important note here:** We aim to show one question on a page, but map nested items. Our questionnaires often consist of groups, so we want to have a clear hierarchy towards the user. The responses are stored in a custom store with `zustand` and only sent to server on click to next button. If there is debugging needed you most likely want to look into passed `onSave` and `onSubmit` functions.
