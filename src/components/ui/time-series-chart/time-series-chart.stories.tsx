  description:
    "Basophils are a type of white blood cell that the bone marrow makes. They are part of the granulocyte family, along with neutrophils and eosinophils. Granulocytes contain granules that release important substances that influence the behavior of other cells and other biologic substances. Basophils circulate in the blood and migrate to tissues where they encounter foreign substances or signals of inflammation. Basophils release their granules, which contain histamine, heparin, serotonin, and other molecules that play a role in inflammation and allergic reactions.\n\nThere are no normal ranges for this measurement of the %'s, so do not be alarmed by the n/a or missing range.",
  importance:
    "Basophils are important because they reflect your immune system's response to invaders, such as bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi, as well as allergens, such as pollen, dust mites, or animal dander. Basophils can also modulate the activity of other immune cells, such as mast cells, T cells, and B cells. Basophils can help protect you from infections and parasites, but they can also cause symptoms of allergies and asthma .",
