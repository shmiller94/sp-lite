          "- No fasting is required.\n- It is recommended to eat lighter (e.g. no fried, greasy, heavy foods) and to eat less gassy foods (e.g. soda, seltzer water, beans, broccoli, cabbage, etc.) before the scan.\n- Try to limit fluid intake approximately 1.5 – 2 hours prior to your appointment so you don't feel the need to stop the scan.\n- Connect with your membership advisor if you have any questions or concerns ahead of testing.",

        question: "What's measured?",
        answer:
          'The VO2 Max test assesses your aerobic capacity, by measuring ventilation, and the maximal oxygen your body can consume during exercise (the oxygen and carbon dioxide concentration of the inhaled and exhaled air). In addition to measuring your fitness level, results will help you establish optimal heart rate (HR) zones for exercise as well as your resting and exercise metabolic rate (RMR / EMR).\n\nYour results will include recorded VO2 and heart rate at start, Aerobic Threshold, Anaerobic Threshold, Max, and 2-minute heart rate recovery data.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Why is this test important?',
        answer:
          'VO2 max is widely used as an indicator of health. In 2016, the American Heart Association published a scientific statement recommending that cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), quantifiable as VO2 max, be regularly assessed and utilized as a clinical vital sign. This statement was based on mounting evidence that lower fitness levels are associated with high risk of cardiovascular disease, all-cause mortality, and mortality rates stemming from various types of cancers.\n\nAdditionally, understanding your resting and exercise metabolic rates provides increased resolution for structuring weight management, dietary, and fitness plans that are personalized to how your body utilizes fuel in resting and active states.',
