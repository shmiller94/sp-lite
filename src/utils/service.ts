    'Grail Galleri Multi Cancer Test': {
      "What's measured?": `Galleri is a cancer screening test that leverages DNA sequencing and pattern-recognition technology to screen for the presence of a cancer signal and predict its most likely origin. Galleri uses DNA sequencing technology to analyze DNA fragments circulating in the blood, also known as cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Both non-cancer and cancer cells release cfDNA into the blood, but cfDNA from cancer cells has methylation patterns that are specific to cancer. Galleri checks over 1 million methylation sites covering >100,000 genomic regions in cfDNA and applies machine learning and pattern-recognition to identify abnormal methylation patterns that could signal the presence of cancer.

It is important to note that the Galleri test does not directly detect or diagnose cancer, but rather is capable of assessing the presence of DNA mutations associated with the development of several types of cancer.`,
      'Why is this test important?': `
Cancer risk increases for everyone as they age regardless of family history—only 5% to 10% of cancers are inherited. Age is the biggest risk factor for cancer. In fact, adults over age 50 are 13 times more likely to have cancer compared to people under the age of 50. 

Before ordering the test, you will meet with your dedicated Superpower physician to discuss your risk factors to determine whether this test is appropriate for you. `,
      'Test process': `1.  Your membership advisor will reach out to schedule a pre-test consultation with your physician to discuss the risk & benefits of testing.

2. We'll order your test kit and deliver it directly to your house or confirmed address in 3-5 days.

3. Schedule your at-home blood draw appointment with a phlebotomist via your membership advisor.

4. Receive your results within 2-3 weeks. 

5. Schedule a consultation with your physician to review your results and create an action plan.`,
      'Pre-test considerations': `There are no fasting requirements associated with this test. 
Connect with your membership advisor if you have any questions or concerns ahead of testing.`,
    },
    'Food & Environmental Allergy Testing': {
      "What's measured?": `This test measures IgE antibodies to over 150 food and environmental allergens as well as IgG antibodies to over 250 food allergens across the following categories:

      ° Pollen, including grass,
      trees, and weeds
      ° Mites
      ° Microorganisms and Spores,
      including yeast and mold
      ° Plant foods
      ° Cereals, including wheat,
      rye, barley, and more
      ° Fruits and Vegetables
      ° Nuts and Seeds, including
      component testing for
      peanuts, pecans, walnuts,
      poppy seeds
      ° Animal Food, including milk,
      eggs, seafood, and meat
      ° Insect Venoms, including
      component testing for
      wasps and honeybees`,
      'Test Process': `1. Order your test kit -- we'll deliver it directly to your house in 3-5 days.

3. Receive your results within two weeks. 

4. Schedule a consultation with your clinical team to review your results and create an action plan.`,
      'Why is this test important?': `There are important differences between food allergies and food allergies. Different arms of the immune system facilitate both conditions. True allergies are immediate, potentially life-threatening, mast-cell mediated, and often involve IgE antibodies, whereas food sensitivities are delayed reactions and elicit IgG antibodies.

It's best practice to measure IgE and IgG antibodies together as they independently create inflammation and play a role in symptoms driven by food. A food can elicit an IgE sensitivity response, an IgG antibody response, or both.`,
      'Pre-test considerations': `1. Hydrate the day prior to sample collection.

2. Drink water 30 minutes before you draw your blood.

3. Continue taking any nutritional supplements and medications unless advised differently by your healthcare provider.

      'Why is this test important?': `One out of seven Americans is at least somewhat sensitive to wheat. This sensitivity may damage the intestinal lining, causing further inflammation.
Uncovering wheat sensitivities is an easy and critical step in developing a nutritional plan to reduce inflammation and prevent disease.`,
      'Test process': `1. Order your test kit -- we'll deliver it directly to your house in 3-5 days.

3. Receive your results within two weeks. 

4. Schedule a consultation with your clinical team to review your results and create an action plan.`,
      'Why is this test important?': `
Testing for PFAS chemicals in your blood is important because:

°Toxins can bioaccumulate and persist in the body for decades, breaking down slowly or not at all. Toxic build-up can impair detoxification, compromise immunity, and increase oxidative stress.

°Testing for PFAS can reveal the status of toxic metabolites in the body.

°Knowing your PFAS exposure level is the first step to reducing toxic risk and creating a personalized detox and wellness plan to achieve better health.
    `,
      'Pre-test considerations': `1. Do not collect samples while menstruating. 
2. Fasting is not required. However, fasting for 12-24 hours prior to 
    collection may increase the excretion of toxins. 
3. Please consult your healthcare provider prior to fasting. 
4. Do not drink more than 8 oz water 1 hour prior to urine collection.`,

° Try to limit fluid intake approximately 1.5 – 2 hours prior to your appointment so you don’t feel the need to stop the scan.

° Connect with your membership advisor if you have any questions or concerns ahead of testing.`,
    },
    'VO2 Max Test': {
      "What's measured?": `The VO2 Max test assesses your aerobic capacity, by measuring ventilation, and the maximal oxygen your body can consume during exercise (the oxygen and carbon dioxide concentration of the inhaled and exhaled air). In addition to measuring your fitness level, results will help you establish optimal heart rate (HR) zones for exercise as well as your resting and exercise metabolic rate (RMR / EMR).

Your results will include recorded VO2 and heart rate at start, Aerobic Threshold, Anaerobic Threshold, Max, and 2-minute heart rate recovery data.`,
      'Why is this test important?': `VO2 max is widely used as an indicator of health. In 2016, the American Heart Association published a scientific statement recommending that cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), quantifiable as VO2 max, be regularly assessed and utilized as a clinical vital sign. This statement was based on mounting evidence that lower fitness levels are associated with high risk of cardiovascular disease, all-cause mortality, and mortality rates stemming from various types of cancers.

Additionally, understanding your resting and exercise metabolic rates provides increased resolution for structuring weight management, dietary, and fitness plans that are personalized to how your body utilizes fuel in resting and active states. `,
      'Test process': `1. Order your test. 

2. Your membership advisor will reach out to schedule a convenient time for your appointment.

4. Go to one of our partnered clinics and complete your test.

° Total non-fat mass

° Bone mass

° Regional body fat and non-fat mass distribution (trunk, arms, legs and android/gynoid regions)

° Generalized bone mineral density

° Visceral Fat/Abdominal Fat (VAT) reading.`,
      'Why is this test important?': `Most people are accustomed to stepping on a bathroom scale every now and then, but monitoring weight – while helpful – is not a precise method of assessing wellness and fitness. 

A DEXA scan provides an in-depth body fat analysis including segmental fat mass, lean mass, and bone density. Knowing this information about your body is crucial for optimizing your wellness, preventing disease, and tracking change over time.`,
      'Test process': `1. Order your test.
