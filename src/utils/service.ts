    'Grail Galleri Multi Cancer Test': {
      "What's measured?": `Galleri is a cancer screening test that leverages DNA sequencing and pattern-recognition technology to screen for the presence of a cancer signal and predict its most likely origin. Galleri uses DNA sequencing technology to analyze DNA fragments circulating in the blood, also known as cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Both non-cancer and cancer cells release cfDNA into the blood, but cfDNA from cancer cells has methylation patterns that are specific to cancer. Galleri checks over 1 million methylation sites covering >100,000 genomic regions in cfDNA and applies machine learning and pattern-recognition to identify abnormal methylation patterns that could signal the presence of cancer.

It is important to note that the Galleri test does not directly detect or diagnose cancer, but rather is capable of assessing the presence of DNA mutations associated with the development of several types of cancer.`,
      'Why is this test important?': `Cancer risk increases for everyone as they age regardless of family history—only 5% to 10% of cancers are inherited. Age is the biggest risk factor for cancer. In fact, adults over age 50 are 13 times more likely to have cancer compared to people under the age of 50.`,
      'Test process': `1. We'll order your test kit and deliver it directly to your house or confirmed address in 3-5 days.

2. Schedule your at-home blood draw appointment with a phlebotomist via your membership advisor.

      'Pre-test considerations': `° Do not wear any items with metal or hard plastic, such as buttons, zippers, jewelry, watches, hair clips, bras with metal clasps or underwires. 

° Inform the technician if you have metal in your body, such as a pin or replacement joint.

° Do not take calcium supplements for 24 hours prior to testing. 

° Best practice is to perform a 4-hour fast prior to testing, although it's not required.

° Arrive hydrated to your test.

° Refrain from this test if you believe you may be pregnant.

° Attire: Wear comfortable clothes, such as gym attire.

° Connect with your membership advisor if you have any questions or concerns ahead of testing. `,
